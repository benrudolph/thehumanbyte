Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a software engineer interested in the intersection of humanitarism and technology. I love
software engineering because it's like being paid to play with legos, digital legos that is. I have lots of
interests, including but not limited to:

- Travel
- Gymnastics
- Diving
- Writing
- Photography
- Javascript
- Testing
- UX Design


Feel free to say hi!
